        <p>Hello! My name is Bavekuno Brian from Jinja, Uganda. I do enjoy having fun with my family while playing table
            games and out door games.
            I am currently a student at BYU Idaho and persuing a Bachelor's degree in Software development.
            Am so excited to network with many of my fellow software developers and so ambitious to create many
            significant Software projects.

        <p>Uganda is the pearl of Africa. This is because the country is enriched with alot of natural beauties like
            land forms, flora and fauna as well as its beautiful climate. The country has fertile soils and good weather
            conditions.
